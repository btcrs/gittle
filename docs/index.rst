Welcome to Groot's documentation!
==========================================

Groot is an open source Git server written in Python. The project stands as a foundation 
for the Wevolver platform, and will be used to help hardware developers collalorate more effectively
and build better hardware faster.

Groot aims to be robust and relatively simple in functionality. Groot, on top of the base set of Git features
expected from a Git server, provides a set of key functionalities that are specific to hardware development.
