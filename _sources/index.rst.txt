Welcome to Welder's documentation!
==========================================

Welder is an open source Git server written in Python. The project stands as a foundation 
for the Wevolver platform, and will be used to help hardware developers collaborate more effectively
and build better hardware faster.

Welder aims to be robust and relatively simple in its execution. Welder, on top of the base set of Git features
expected from a Git server, also provides a set of key functionalities that are specific to hardware development.
